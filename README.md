# pyPFASST
pyPFASST is an Python implementation of the parallel full approximation scheme in space and time written by myself.

# Structure
The repository consists of my first implementation of PFASST. It is based on the description in
    "Toward an efficient parallel in time method for partial differential equations" by Michael L. Minion, Matthew Emmett (2012).
    
Furthermore, structure of PFASST is oriented on
